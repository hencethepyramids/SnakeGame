# SnakeGame

"Snake" is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself. The objective is to eat as much food as possible to increase the snake's length and score while maneuvering through a confined grid. As the game progresses, it becomes more challenging to avoid self-intersection and maintain control over the snake's movements. Players aim to achieve the highest score possible before ultimately ending the game when the snake collides with a wall or itself. It's a simple yet addictive game that tests players' reflexes, strategy, and ability to navigate increasingly complex mazes.
